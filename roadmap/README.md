# Roadmap

One file per item. Each has a status, the reason it matters, a design sketch, and what "done" means, so anyone can pick one up. Order within a phase is priority order. The long-form reasoning behind these choices is in [docs/master-plan.md](../docs/master-plan.md).

Items 12–23 came from the [roadmap gap review](../docs/roadmap-review.md); 12, 13 and 17 contain launch-week bug fixes and go first. Items 24–27 came from the [performance research round](../docs/research/), whose four designs live in `docs/research/`. Item 28 is the FIELD STATION multi-model track: broaden quantisation first, then architecture adapters and Hugging Face preflight.

**Explicitly not on the roadmap** (see [GOVERNANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE.md)): accounts, tokens or ads, open swarms of strangers by default, distributed training, noise/permutation "privacy" features, frontier-scale natives that cannot fit a room. Native and headless peers *are* on it (11); the browser path just never stops being enough on its own.

## Status meanings
- **research**: needs a design note before code; open an issue with the *Research / design proposal* template.
- **planned**: design agreed in the item file; ready to build.
- **in progress**: someone is on it (named in the file).
